Roadmap
============

1. Develop the ordx protocol to support deploy and mint operations, as well as indexing services. (January 2024)
2. Enable order book trading for ordx assets on the website. (March 2024)
3. Implement the functionality to issue FT on special sats. (April 2024)
4. OLDEX: Build a decentralized exchange (DEX) on the Lightning Network, allowing everyone to participate in economical and fast transactions of ordinals assets. (June 2024)

The goal is to create a DEX on the Lightning Network where all assets based on the Ordinals protocol can be traded economically and quickly without compromising user control. The target is to achieve transaction confirmation times within 5 seconds and transaction costs below 5% of the mainnet transaction fees. We aim to complete all of this work in the first half of 2024. Please note that this is just the beginning. Throughout this development process, we adhere to the following principles and our vision for future trends:
1. Asset issuance on the BTC main chain: There will be an increasing number of assets on the BTC mainnet.
2. Asset trading on the Lightning Network: Assets remain under user control, providing an economical and fast trading experience.
