About Us
====

We are a group of technology optimists, a technical team focused on the BTC ecosystem. We are solely dedicated to ordx protocol development. We do not issue any tokens and do not have an official community. Any tokens issued using the ordx protocol are community-driven initiatives. We are willing to provide technical support to the community as long as it aligns with the principles of the ordx protocol and falls within our capabilities. We are committed to continuously building the BTC ecosystem.
